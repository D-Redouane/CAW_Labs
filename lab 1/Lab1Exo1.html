    <h1><em>Machine Learning</em></h1>
    <h2><b>Supervised Learning</b></h2>
    <p><em>Supervised learning</em> is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from <i>labeled data</i>, making predictions or decisions without human intervention. It involves the use of a training dataset to teach the algorithm, allowing it to generalize and make predictions on new, unseen data effectively. This approach is widely used in various fields, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.</p>
    <p><em>Unsupervised learning</em> involves finding patterns and relationships in data without labeled outputs, often used in clustering and dimensionality reduction. Unlike supervised learning, it doesn't rely on predefined labels. Instead, it aims to discover hidden structures or groups within the data, making it valuable in tasks like customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data exploration.</p>

    <h1><em>Natural Language Processing</em></h1>
    <h2><b>Text Classification</b></h2>
    <p><em>Text classification</em> is a task in NLP where text documents are categorized into predefined categories, like spam or not spam emails. It plays a crucial role in email filtering, sentiment analysis, and content recommendation. To achieve accurate text classification, NLP models often utilize techniques such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and deep learning architectures.</p>
    <h2><b>Speech Recognition</b></h2>
    <p><em>Speech recognition</em> converts spoken language into text, enabling voice assistants and transcription services. It has evolved significantly with the advent of deep learning and recurrent neural networks. Modern speech recognition systems, like those used in virtual assistants, can understand and respond to natural language, making them increasingly popular in everyday applications.</p>
    <h2><b>Language Generation</b></h2>
    <p><em>Language generation</em> uses AI to create human-like text. This technology is employed in chatbots, content generation, and even creative writing assistance. Models like GPT-3 have demonstrated remarkable language generation capabilities, raising exciting possibilities for natural language understanding and generation.</p>

    <h1><em>Computer Vision</em></h1>
    <h2><b>Image Recognition</b></h2>
    <p><em>Image recognition</em> is the process of identifying objects or features in images or videos. It finds applications in autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and security systems. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been particularly successful in image recognition tasks, achieving human-level accuracy in various benchmark datasets.</p>
    <h2><b>Object Detection</b></h2>
    <p><em>Object detection</em> locates and classifies objects within an image or video frame. It's essential in fields like surveillance, robotics, and augmented reality. Object detection models, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN, have made significant advancements in real-time object detection.</p>
    <h2><b>Image Segmentation</b></h2>
    <p><em>Image segmentation</em> partitions an image into regions based on shared visual characteristics. It's used in medical image analysis, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding. Semantic segmentation and instance segmentation are two common techniques employed in image segmentation tasks.</p>

    <h1><em>Neural Networks</em></h1>
    <h2><b>Artificial Neural Networks</b></h2>
    <p><em>Artificial neural networks</em> are computational models inspired by the human brain, used in various AI tasks. They consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized into layers. Neural networks are the foundation of deep learning and have been instrumental in solving complex problems, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.</p>
    <h2><b>Deep Learning</b></h2>
    <p><em>Deep learning</em> refers to neural networks with multiple layers, capable of learning complex representations. It has revolutionized AI by achieving remarkable results in tasks like image classification, machine translation, and game strategy. Deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used in various applications.</p>
