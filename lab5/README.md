## Overview:

Welcome to the React Component Lab, a lab developed by our team to explore and implement various React functionalities. In this lab, we've created a set of React components to address different exercises. 

### Features:

- **Exercise 1:** Implemented components for a button, toggle button, App component with three buttons, and a counter with increment and decrement buttons.

- **Exercise 2:** Created components to display a table of values as an unordered list, with options to modify the display and remove elements.

- **Exercise 3:** Developed an authentication form component that, upon submission, displays a list of users with a delete button for each entry.

- **Exercise 4:** Designed a component with a form allowing the addition of div elements to the page, with customizable height, width, and background color.
