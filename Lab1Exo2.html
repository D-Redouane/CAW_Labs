    <p>Below is an image illustrating the concept of Artificial Neural Networks:</p>
    <p>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a fundamental concept in the field of Artificial Intelligence. They are a
        computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. ANNs consist of interconnected
        nodes, or artificial neurons, organized in layers. Information flows through these layers, with each neuron
        processing data and passing it to the next layer.</p>

    <p>ANNs are used in various machine learning tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and
        data analysis. They are particularly effective at handling complex and unstructured data. ANNs have gained
        popularity in recent years due to their ability to learn and adapt from large datasets, making them a key
        component of deep learning, a subfield of AI.</p>
    <p>Understanding how ANNs work is essential for anyone interested in AI and machine learning. They play a crucial
        role in powering many AI applications that have become integral to our daily lives.</p>
